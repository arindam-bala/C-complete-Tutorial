OOPs - Classes and Objects
C++ --> initially called --> C with classes by Stroustroup
class --> extension of structures (in C) 
Structures had limitations
        - members are public
        - No methods
Classes --> Structures + more
Classes --> can have methods and properties
Classes --> can make few members as private & few as public
Structures in C++ are typedefed
YOU can declare objects along with class declaration like 
this:
            class Employee {
                //class defination 
            } arindam, bikram, soumen;

arindam.salary --> makes no sense if salary is private
